              - queue reset
              - any restart on command: webserial, mqtt, button, etc

              - MQTT error
              - wifi error
              - queue error
            - if badbootcount > MAX_BAD_BOOT_COUNT erase_nvs() is performed

          - void measure_temp_pressure(char *pressure);
          - publish config before publishing values always

         - if wifi not ok CP starts
         - if CP timeout occures nvs is reset, old wifi credentials are restored, restart happens and it tries WiFi again 
         - CP blinks LED provided in wifi_connected = connect_wifi(STATUS_GW_LED_GPIO_RED); returns bool true when connected
