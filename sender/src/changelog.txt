          - max sleep time in Captive Portal: 86400s (24h)

2022-12-10:
  2.3.0   - wifi_ok added to myData to indicate if WiFi is configured on device sensor
  2.2.0   - platformio.ini scripted - choosing boards in platformio.ini now - not in devices_config.h (but still full board config is in devices_config.h) 

2022-12-09:
  2.1.0   - sorted (?) AP and CP that were not starting (removed STA connection just before AP connection -> now AP works) 
          - sorted lack of some GPIO configured for html page
          - RED LED ON if wifi not configured (although ESPNow works without WiFi configured)

2022-12-08:

// ============================ END OF VERSION 1.x.x ==========================
2022-12-02:
  1.24.b1 - no more fixed WiFi channel, all senders send to 1 of GW from the pool, each GW has fixed fake MAC address, based on their availability - not according to signal strength

2022-11-10:
  1.23.1  - added ESP32S

2022-11-06:

2022-10-20:
  1.22.2   - C3 added in devices_config.h check: #if (BOARD_TYPE == 4)

2022-10-20:
  1.22.1   - new sender_type = battery for TRV battery sensors

2022-10-19:
  1.22.0   - added ESP32-C3, different wake up from GPIO (hibernate) and different cause of wake up (setup)
           - ESP32-C3 can wake up on HIGH or LOW, set up done on HIGH to be compatible with S/S2 boards
           - BOOTLOADER GPIO for ESP32-C3 is GPIO_9
           - SDA = GPIO_8
           - SCL = GPIO_9 - same as bootloader GPIO

2022-10-17:
  1.21.6   - sorting LED when FW_UPGRADE_GPIO pressed:
            1 - red when pressed
            2 - after 3s red off, blue on
            3 - after next 3s red on, blue off

2022-10-16:
  1.21.2  - don't check MOTION_SENSOR_GPIO after wake up - just base on wake up reason
            it was bringing too many false positive motion=1

2022-10-16:
  1.21.1  - added additional function to FW_UPGRADE_GPIO button:
            - 1 short press: fw_update
            - 1 press for 3 seconds (red goes to green at the end, then release it) - ESP.reset() - it resets MAX17048 and bootCount
            - 1 press for 6 seconds (green goes to red at the end, then release it) - format FS, - it resets ontime, bootCount and MAX17048
              as sensors without charger would never reset ontime, even after changing/charging the battery

  1.18.1  - adding MAX17048 data from new boards
  1.18.0  - correction in ext1 wakeup gpio mask - it calculates mask instead of hard coded pins
